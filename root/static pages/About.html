        <h1>SETTING THE PACE
            FOR A RETAIL REVOLUTION</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in 2012, Lazada Group is Southeast Asia’s leading eCommerce platform. With a presence in six
            countries
            – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – we connect this vast and diverse
            region
            through our technology, logistics and payments capabilities. Today, we have the largest selection of brands
            and
            sellers,
            and by 2030, we aim to serve 300 million customers. In 2016, Lazada became the regional flagship of the
            Alibaba
            Group, and is backed by
            Alibaba’s best-in-class technology infrastructure.

            OUR CORE PILLARS

        <h3>LOGISTIC</h3>
        <p>
            With end-to-end logistics capabilities and complete control over our supply chain, virtually any product is
            a click away.
            We have fulfillment centres across 17 Southeast Asian cities, and our investment in warehouses,
            sorting centres, and digital technologies complement our partner network and our cross-border and last mile
            arrangements in each country.

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
            At Lazada, we harness both existing and emerging technologies to redefine the retail experience. Leveraging
            data in real time allows us
            to quickly adapt to changing demands and conditions. We connect consumers to brands, create customised
            experiences, and have evolved into
            a retail destination that customers come to for both shopping and entertainment. And we continue to push the
            boundaries. Project Voyager,
            our technology stack jointly developed with Alibaba, powers Lazada with the most scalable and competitive
            product and technology solutions
            for the next decade.

        <h3>Payments</h3>
        <p>
            Ensuring secure and seamless transactions guides the development of Southeast Asia’s most secure payments and
            financial services infrastructure. In a region still at varying stages of e-payment and eCommerce adoption, we’ve 
            evolved a suite of options that cater to existing preferences while easing customers into digital payments through 
            intuitive solutions they can trust.
